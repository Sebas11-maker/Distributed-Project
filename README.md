Academic Tutoring Management System 📚🚀

Welcome to the Academic Tutoring Management System repository! This project is a distributed system designed to manage academic tutoring processes in an efficient, scalable, and modern way. It integrates multiple services and a frontend application to provide a complete solution for students, tutors, and administrators.

Project Overview 🎓
This system focuses on the management of academic tutoring, allowing institutions to organize tutoring sessions, manage users, and ensure smooth communication between different components. The project follows a microservices-based architecture, separating responsibilities into independent domains to improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment.

The repository contains both backend domains and the frontend application, all coordinated to work together as a unified system.

Main Components 🧩
Authentication Domain:
Handles user authentication and authorization, including login, registration, and secure access using modern security practices.

User Domain:
Manages user-related operations such as student and tutor information, roles, and profile data.

Frontend:
A React-based web application that serves as the user interface for the system, allowing users to interact with the tutoring platform easily and intuitively.

CI/CD Workflows:
GitHub Actions workflows for automating builds, tests, and deployments in production environments.

Core Features 🎯
Academic Tutoring Management:
Creation, scheduling, and management of tutoring sessions.

User Management:
Support for different user roles (students, tutors, administrators) with secure authentication.

Distributed Architecture:
Microservices-based design to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

Containerized Deployment:
Docker and Nginx support for consistent and reliable deployments.

Technologies Used ⚙️
Frontend:
- React
- CSS
- Nginx

Backend:
- Python (Flask / FastAPI depending on domain)
- SQL-based databases

Infrastructure & DevOps:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

This repository represents the main entry point of the Academic Tutoring Management System, bringing together all components required to run the platform as a complete distributed application. Contributions, improvements, and suggestions are always welcome.
