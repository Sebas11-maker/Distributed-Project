
# Controllers Folder 📂

## Overview 🌟

The **controllers** folder contains the logic for managing the incoming HTTP requests and providing the appropriate responses. Specifically, the **captcha_controller.py** file is responsible for handling requests related to the generation and delivery of CAPTCHA images.

### Role of the **captcha_controller.py** File 📝

- **HTTP Request Handling**: The **captcha_controller.py** file handles the HTTP requests for the `/generate-captcha` endpoint. It listens for GET requests and returns a randomly generated CAPTCHA image.
- **Controller Logic**: The controller interacts with the **CaptchaService** to generate the CAPTCHA content (text and image). Once the CAPTCHA is generated, it is sent to the client in the form of a PNG image, allowing the user to interact with it during login or registration.
- **CORS**: The controller also configures **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**, allowing the CAPTCHA service to be accessed from any domain, making it suitable for integration with web and mobile applications.

### Why This Folder Is Important 🔑

- **Separation of Concerns**: The controller focuses solely on handling HTTP requests and responses, ensuring that the business logic (which resides in the service layer) is not cluttered with web framework-specific code.
- **API Management**: This folder is crucial for routing requests to the appropriate services. By isolating the controller logic, we achieve cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Scalability**: As more endpoints are added (e.g., additional CAPTCHA types), the controller can easily be extended to accommodate these changes without affecting other parts of the application.

### In Summary 📝
The **controllers** folder plays a vital role in managing the flow of requests within the application. The **captcha_controller.py** file handles the **/generate-captcha** endpoint, interacting with the **CaptchaService** to provide CAPTCHA images to users. The separation of concerns and modularity make the code easy to scale and maintain as the application evolves.
