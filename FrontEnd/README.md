## 📦 Project Overview

**FrontEnd2** is a modern e-commerce web application built with **React** designed for the sale of water products. This repository contains the front-end code that interacts with the back-end services and allows users to browse, select, and purchase various water products. 

### 🚀 Main Features:
- **Product Catalog**: View a wide selection of water products, including different sizes and brands.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove products, view item details, and calculate total prices.
- **User Authentication**: Login and register to create accounts for easy tracking of purchases and favorites.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React** ⚛️: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js** 🟩: A JavaScript runtime used for the server-side.
- **Docker** 🐳: Containerized setup to ensure seamless development and production environments.
- **Nginx** 🕸️: Web server used to serve the application.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This front-end application serves as the user interface for the water product e-commerce system. It communicates with back-end APIs, allowing customers to:
- Browse product categories.
- Add products to their shopping cart.
- Proceed to checkout and make purchases.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Interface**: The app is built with React components that handle user interaction. The state is managed using React's built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
2. **Backend Communication**: API calls are made using JavaScript's `fetch` or Axios to interact with the server-side.
3. **Dockerized Deployment**: The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring that the app runs in any environment with the same configuration.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Integration with payment gateways 💳
- Admin dashboard to manage products and orders 📊
- User profile management ✨
